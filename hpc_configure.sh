#	Downloads and builds PDT and TAU tools for Ubuntu Linux.
#	Also does a basic setup of the HPC coursework.
#	    * Clones the University of Bristol HPC Coursework sample repository, 
#	    * Corrects the makefile, 
#	    * Builds and executes the sample program using TAU
#	    * Executes pprof to analyse the results

# ================= READ THIS STUFF =================
#
# FAIR WARNING:
#	This script deletes files and directories that it thinks it may have previously created.
#	Namely: 
#		~/pdt
#		~/tau
#		~/Documents/UoB-HPC-LBM-2016
#
#	If you already have files in those folders, don't run this script! Because they're going to be deleted. 
#	Back them up first then run this script.
#
#
# How to use:
#	1. Save file into your home directory (cd ~/)
# 	2. chmod +x ~/hpc_configure.sh
#	3. ~/hpc_configure.sh
#	4. (First time only!) y - to modify path
# 	5. Restart your command prompt (bash)
#	6. It should just work now. 
#
# This script can safely be run multiple times
#	- Remember to answer "n" to the PATH update bit
#	- It will delete all previously created files, so if you make changes then re-run this script, 
#	  you'll lose the changes.
#
# Requirements:
#	- The script makes sure your system is up to date and has all the necessary tools installed (see System Setup section)
# 	- You may need to type in your password for the sudo apt-get bits ;) )
# 	- You'll need an internet connection - a fast one! (Total downloads are >600MB)
